How to Change your System Locale This will NOT change your system's display language! What is your system locale? Your system locale is how your computer displays non-unicode text in programs. Why do you need to change it? In order to display Japanese text, which is a requirement for simulators, your locale needs to be set to Japanese so that your computer can parse songs with Japanese names and load any song audio. This process is fairly similar for Windows 7 and Windows XP, but it should not be too far off. Go to your Control Panel in Windows, using the search bar or using the shortcut in the Windows menu. Then, go to the Clock and Region tab. Select Region , and click the \"Administrative\" panel. Hit the \"Change system locale...\" button and select \"Japanese (Japan)\" . DO NOT hit the checkmark underneath! Restart your computer, and you're all done! Install the Taiko no Tatsujin Fonts Your computer does not come with the necessary fonts used in most modern simulators, so they need to be manually installed. Download the required fonts.

No restart is required after font installation. For the standard taiko font, extra compatibility has been added to select songs. In order to enable this compatibility, the song names in the TJA file must be changed. \u203d\u30ab\u30aa\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0\u203d \u4e9c\u7a7a\u9593\u904a\u6cf3ac\u2493 \u30a2\u30eb\u30e0\u30b8\u30abac\u2495.0V \u6bd2\u216cCAN\u216e\u2661 poxei\u2662DOON (Any song with !!) -> \u203c How to Obtain Songs Finding songs can be tricky, especially for people who can't speak or read Japanese. This guide provides reliable sources for finding good quality charts (TJAs) and audio. Please make sure your simulator is working before you download songs. TJADB TJADB is the most up-to-date and efficient way to find the highest quality audio and charts, mainly for official songs. Custom songs are also included in a separate user submission channel. At this time, all songs that are available in \u592a\u9f13\u306e\u9054\u4eba\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 2.0 (Green Version Japan + Asia) are available. You can find TJADB on Discord here . A website will soon be available too! GetUploader GetUploader, otherwise known as \"uploader.jp\" or \"ux.getuploader.com\", is where many Japanese TJA creators and users upload their works online. Sources from here can be of varying quality, and a large majority of them are custom. Zen Gaido Fumen Haifu (\u5168\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u8b5c\u9762\u914d\u5e03) is a generally good source on the website with up to date official charts and a variety of customs.
